# Install Python

## Python for Linux

Python comes preinstalled in most linux distros.

There are two main versions of python. Both are probably already installed in your computer if you use Linux.
- python2
- python3

The default version of python is, in some cases, python2.

## Python for Windows and Mac OS:

## Install a specific Python version in Linux

Download the Python source code for the specific version and operating system you need at:

[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Then, follow the instructions in `README.rst`, in section **Build Instructions**. 

Reference: [https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#building-python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#building-python)


## Use Python Interpreter (terminal)

You can access the Python Interpreter via terminal by typing:
```shell
python
```
This will open the interpreter for the default version of python, which is, in some cases, python2. 

If you want to ensure a version for python, you can type:
```shell
# Open python2 interpreter
python2
# Open python2.7 interpreter
python2.7
# Open python3 interpreter
python3
# Open python3.6 interpreter
python3.6
```
